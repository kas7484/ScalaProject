Scala Project

This project contains solutions to Scala prompts. The solutions are implemented using Scala programming language and can be executed using the sbt tool.

Prerequisites

Scala 2.13
sbt 1.5.5
Usage

To run the solutions, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory of the project. Then, run the following command:

arduino
Copy code
sbt run
This will execute the main method in the Main.scala file, which will run all the solutions and print the results to the console.

Alternatively, you can run individual solutions by executing the corresponding main method in the solution files.
